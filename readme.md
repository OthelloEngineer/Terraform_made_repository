Hello, this is an awesome repository made automaticcaly from a terraform/powershell script

Generate a Github Personal Access Token as a parameter, clone this directory from the terraform_branch and execute the powershell with the token to create your own automatic terraform repository here on github



If you have issues with the execution-policy of the powershell script, then execute this commando: 
"Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass"

It's only active during the session of your terminal, so it won't affect your execution-policy permanently :)
